"""MCQ-aware answer grading for MLLM datasets (open-r1, zwz, GeoQA, …).

mllm-only. Deliberately does NOT modify the shared graders
(`co_label_utils.py`, `verifiers/math_verify_wrapper.py`), which are kept
line-for-line aligned with the `trl-projects` (text) copies per the repo
`CLAUDE.md` "consistency over correctness" rule.

Why this exists
---------------
Many MLLM datasets are multiple-choice: the gold solution is an option
*letter* (e.g. `"C"`), but the model commonly echoes the full option text
inside `<answer>` (e.g. `"C. Pythagorean theorem"`). The math grader
(`grade_answer`) scores that as wrong, so a model that picked the right
option still gets reward 0. On `multimodal-open-r1-8k-verified` this drove
Qwen2.5-VL-3B's train reward to ~0.01 (far below the 0.25 MCQ chance floor)
even though ~5/8 sampled completions were actually correct, a grading
bug, not a learning failure. See `QWEN_FLAT_ZWZ_INVESTIGATION.md`.

Design (validated against the real open-r1 gold distribution)
------------------------------------------------------------
`grade_mcq_or_math` runs the existing math/exact grader FIRST, then adds a
*conservative* option-letter match as a fallback (OR semantics). This is
strictly safer than letter-first matching:

  - It can only ADD credit; it never removes a correct math/numeric grade.
  - `mcq_letter` only fires on unambiguous option forms, so it does NOT
    misfire on the many golds where A–E are geometry point labels or compass
    directions (`"D is the midpoint of AC"`, `"N 23.5° E"`, `"O, B, C"`),
    which all correctly route to the math grader.

Known residual limits (accepted, ~0.3% of open-r1):
  - golds like `"90 degrees (D)"` (value + trailing bare paren) are not
    letter-matched (a trailing `"(D)"` rule would risk catching point labels).
  - completions that omit the `<answer>` tag still score 0 (intentional -
    learning the R1-V format is a training objective).

NOT addressed here (flagged separately): `_majority_vote` clusters rollouts
by `normalize_answer`, so `"C. Pythagorean"` and `"C"` hash to different
keys and fragment the vote, this degrades self-label / co-learn pseudo-label
quality on MCQ data and needs its own fix.
